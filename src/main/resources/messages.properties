#Preporty Name Rule
# yourObjectName.objectField -> employee.firstName
employee.firstName= First name

#_________________________

#Pattern
# ValidationAnnotationName.yourObjectName.objectField
NotBlank.employee.firstName ={0} is a required field.
# you can use index number of the annotation instead of First name

Size.employee.firstName = {0} can have max {1} and min {2} characters
# {1} and {2} checks whatever we have in annotation
